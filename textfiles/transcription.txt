pleasurable parties in the city She is responsible for arranging erotic night parties where the inhabitants of New London can come and relieve themselves Bernard tells her about the deceased epsilon and how he may have committed the unthinkable But Watson rebuffs his claims claiming that it's impossible She also asserts that even if an epsilon starts thinking on their own The Soma pill will never allow them to become depressed and commit such an act The series then cuts to the savage lands where we are introduced to our other protagonist John He is a hard working and honest man who works as the props manager for a savage circus However, he is often bullied by his boss and other colleagues for being weak He lives with his alcoholic but caring mother Linda who stays at home all day Waiting for her estranged husband to return John always tells her to forget about the past and move on but she doesn't want to That night as the two are sleeping John wakes up when he hears someone outside He grabs a weapon and slowly opens the door Only to see his best friend Madison and a bunch of other armed people there And before he can say anything the strange people apprehend him and take him away Shortly after John is taken to a secluded place where the leader of the group Sheila introduces herself She reveals that her people are a resistant cult who are adamant on driving out the new world's scumbags Here we get to know that a minority of the savage lands have become tired of being treated as animals by the new Londoners Hence they want to put an end to it all And since John works for the props department he's in charge of loading the fake guns Sheila wants him to load the guns with real bullets so that they can massacre the next batch of new Londoners Scared, John says that he can't do it but Sheila warns that if he doesn't He and his mother will be hunted down Elsewhere Bernard is still disoriented and confused by the visions he saw earlier that day Hence to relax himself he takes his eye chip out for a while But as soon as he does so the director of new London ed calls him to his office There he tells Bernard that he is unfit to be an alpha plus because he is not assertive and demanding enough He also reprimands Bernard for acting private and suggests he take a vacation to the savage lands to clear his mind That evening a slightly upset Bernard runs into Linina and shares everything that transpired with him that day He also reveals that he has started experiencing feelings like loneliness And that is why he is being sent to the savage lands Linina empathizes with him and decides to help him out She agrees to go to the savage lands together with him The next morning they board a rocket which takes them to their destination in less than 12 minutes Take that, Bezos When they reach their hotel the receptionists briefs them about the different tours and attractions that they can partake in savage lands In particular Linina is taken aback by the strange customs here Like getting pregnant driving vehicles fighting with each other and even taming animals After this they board a tour bus and spectate different savage events Which are incomprehensible in new London like the push and pull at a department store Marriage and faith in God On the other hand a reluctant John is forced to load the real bullets into the gun Fearing that the cult members will go after his mother Even his best friend Madison starts ordering him around A while later the last show of the day The House of Monogamy commences and all the new Londoners Including Bernard and Linina are seated in the audience For a while things go as usual But when it's time for the prop gun to fire A real bullet comes out and kills a person The audience still thinks it's part of the show so they watch an excitement But soon some cult members get up from their seats and start shooting at everyone They kill many new Londoners and seeing this Linina finally realizes that something is wrong She quickly grabs Bernard and runs away from the place While barely avoiding the gunshots But unfortunately just as they reach a bit further She realizes that Bernard has been shot in the chest And that he is losing consciousness Somehow she drags him to a nearby residence and starts crying And to make matters worse The cult members arrive outside looking for them John spots them and gets ready to alert the other cult members But when he sees the innocent couple He surprisingly changes his mind and decides to help them Shortly after John brings the couple to his house Whereas kind mother Linda tries her best to save Bernard She takes the bullet out from his body and gets ready to stitch his wounds But just then John's friend Madison arrives outside She has come looking for the final two new Londoners Because apparently someone saw them fleeing in this direction John quickly hides them in the attic and welcomes Madison inside He promises her that he doesn't know about the new Londoners But Madison is skeptical She starts searching around the house and suddenly Bernard gains consciousness and starts wailing in pain In rage that she has been lied to She points her gun at John but fortunately Linda stabs her from behind and kills her Eh Madison sucked anyway After this all four of them get in John's car and leave the house While the cult members close in Along the way they notice that the bus in which the new Londoners arrive has been totally destroyed Bernard who has started feeling a bit better now Starts blaming the savages for everything But Linina inserts that they are alive because of them Meanwhile we learn that John's mother Linda was also an inhabitant of new London And that she had come to the Savage Lans three decades back with her love interest But after she became pregnant she decided to stay in Savage Lans for her son As it is illegal to have a child in new London Her husband left with the promise of coming back but he never did We also learn that there is an electromagnetic barrier which surrounds the Savage Lans If a Savage tries crossing it he or she is immediately burnt to death But a resident of new London like Linda can bypass it effortlessly However her son John who was born under the savage dogs Requires assistance from an alpha plus like Bernard This is why she helped the new Londoners hoping that she and John can return back to their home After a while the group reaches the border which unfortunately is being checked by the cult members Hence Linda guides everyone to a nearby jungle which also has a way across the barrier They travel on foot and are almost there But suddenly a bunch of armed cult soldiers start shooting at them Bernard and Linina quickly cross the barrier And when a cult soldier tries following them he is burnt to ashes What an idiot Seeing this John hesitates to go Giving the cult soldiers ample time to take a shot Fortunately Linda pushes him over the line And John gets out of the Savage Lans without being burnt This is possible because both his parents are new Londoners With this all of them escape the place while the cruel cult leader Sheila stares at them Unfortunately when they board the rocket John realizes that his mother got shot While trying to protect them as she tells them to watch out and take care She slowly succumbs to her injuries In the next scene the group is returned to new London And using the highly advanced medical services Bernard becomes completely healed However, Linina feels strange and is ridden with guilt and sadness Even the Soma cannot help her It appears as if she has started garnering feelings Something which is not possible in new London On the other hand John has been kept confined in a room Where he keeps screaming about his mother Add and Mustafa Monde the most intelligent person in all the land Observe him closely and deduce that the savages are extremely weak When it comes to dealing with someone's demise While Ed wants him to suffer Monde is empathetic and decides to let him integrate into new London for his heroics At last she lets him out of the room And John glances at the advanced city for the first time The next morning the integration of John begins Add and Mustafa Monde assign Bernard with the task as he knows the savage personally However things don't quite go as planned John is scared of even the basic amenities like the elevator The tall skyscrapers and even the Soma He rejects all of them and just remains silent After a while a technician approaches him to measure his eyeballs For the implementation of the endearing ship Surprisingly he realizes that John has a very rare eyeball Which only an alpha exotic person has Alpha exotics are the rarest and the best of all inhabitants And only 0.01% of new Londoners have ever been found as such Despite this revelation, John refuses to have the implant And while Bernard is away he sneaks out of the room He then ventures into the main hall Where all the people are amused to see a savage They call him names and stare at him Until John freaks out and runs away He then heads into the epsilon section Where all of the opinionless people are having breakfast Seeing John scared? The epsilon with feelings from earlier C.Jack60 who for some reason gets to use his gamer tag as his name Invites him to his table and offers him his dinner Surprisingly, John loves it and the tooth start bonding However their interaction is cut short when the director ed Barges into the room and disperses all the upsellons He then convinces John to come along with him Claiming that he can take him to a better place where he truly belongs John who is scared and confused agrees On the other hand, Bernard is also looking for John And he decides to stop by Ed's office for a quick chat Strangely, on the table, he finds Ed's i-chip Which implies that he has gone private Since Ed is also an alpha exotic He quickly takes out John's i-chip from earlier and compares them Loan behold, the two implants match Revealing that John's estranged father is none other than Ed himself He quickly heads to his fellow alpha plus Henry and reveals this But the latter doesn't believe it And instead criticizes Bernard for sneaking into the director's office Elsewhere, Ed takes John near the sea Where a rocket is waiting to take him away to his land John is a bit skeptical because if the cult leaders find him again They will linch him to death But Ed reveals that there are thousands of other cities like the savage lands Where people have built civilizations He knows this because he ventured to several of them including the savage lands Hearing this, John realizes that Ed is his own father Who never came back after conceiving him He demands answers but Ed doesn't seem to care As a result, John gets angry and starts a scuffle Which ends, with Ed accidentally falling off the cliff To his death But since he had left his i-chip in his office No one saw the incident Soon John rushes back to the city and stumbles upon one of Watson's pleasure parties He sees hundreds of people dancing and gets scared But just then, the partygoers notice him They surround John and get ready to have their way with him But fortunately, Bernard arrives in the nick of time and rescues him With this, John finally starts trusting Bernard And he even eats a sumpipil given to him Meanwhile, after the incident at Savage Lance Lannina has started behaving strangely She has always lost in her thoughts Rarely goes out with her friends Behaves rudely sometimes And even tries to keep herself from taking the sumpipils In one instance, she has some fun with the alpha plus Henry But dominates him As if she is the alpha Let's go On the other hand, Mustafa Maunt tells Bernard that their director Ed Accidentally fell to his death Bernard obviously doesn't believe it And instead reveals that he was actually John's father Surprisingly, Maunt already knew of this She mentions that this is why they have to integrate John into their society as soon as possible Because it is the least he deserves Bernard agrees And before leaving, he promises to handle the situation well To start with, he takes John to the Children's Learning Center Where a bunch of kids are now learning how to play a game Expectedly, John is not interested, but still He sits around as the kids don't stare and judge him After this, Bernard takes him to the pleasure party designer Watson's place He introduces the two, but surprisingly Watson already knows about this savage In fact, she is very aroused by him Because of last night's encounter where he attracted a lot of people She wants to have fun with this savage But Bernard tells her that John is very emotional And that's why it wouldn't be a good idea Instead, he promises to bring him along to that evening's pleasure party Elsewhere, Lenina goes to play tennis with her best friend Franny In New London, people play only for fun And not competitiveness or prizes However, Lenina, who has completely changed her behavior Humiliates her friend before walking out of there She then reaches her room and eats several suma pills to calm
